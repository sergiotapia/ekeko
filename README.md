# Ekeko

Ekeko is a tool that helps you save all of your favorited
memes, videos and other online resources.

Ekeko will automatically save your "liked" media, convert it to a
storage friendly 720p x265 format.

## Goals

- Design for humans. Ekeko will bring joy to your life.
- Run on any platform.
- Stand on the shoulders of giants. 
  - This project would be dead on arrival without the priceless work of ytp-dl
  and ffmpeg. 
  - Ekeko will use existing tools as much as possible.
- Simple to run.
- Simple to back up and restore.
- No javascript.
- Easy to find your content using full text search.
  - Ekeko indexes titles, authors and channel.
  - Ekeko transcribes video audio into text form using AI
  and saves the text for indexing.

## Why are you building this?

I revisited a very old account from my high school days and 90% of
the things I remember liking are gone. Totally lost to time.

I want to view the things I liked today, 15 years from now.

At some point Ekeko might even be able to broadcast a "channel" showing
you things you know you enjoyed a decade ago. Great for background viewing.

## Follow the repo for updates

I'm still writing this project, right now it does nothing except download
a specific youtube url. I will slow start building up the app to my vision.
